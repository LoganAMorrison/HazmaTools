# Models

This directory contains the `FeynRules` models used to generate the `FeynArts` model files needed to use models in the `Hazma` framework.
The folders `HazmaScalar`, and `HazmaVector` contain pre-made model files. To use these, copy them into your `FeynCalc/FeynArts/Models` directory.
There is a Mathematica script `GenerateModels.wls` which can be used to recreate these models. One can modify the `GenerateModels.wls` to build other models as well.
