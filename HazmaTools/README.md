# HazmaTools

## `HazmaTools.m`

`HazmaTools.m` is the main package of this repository. It contains all of the functions for computing amplitudes, squared amplitudes, cross-sections, decay widths and photon spectra.

## `HazmaToolsTests.nb`

`HazmaToolsTests.nb` contains various tests for verifying the `HazmaTools` pipeline. Currently, we have the following tests:
- Bhabha scattering,
- Electron/positron pair annihilation to photons,
- Compton scattering,
- Electron/positron pair annihilation to muons
